# Capstone-Project-Antarctic-Ice
My capstone, completed for my Master's in Data Science from RIT. 
A neural network is built using PyTorch from a series of .txt files downloaded 
from the National Snow and Ice Database that ultimately built a model that predicted 
ice elevations based on location and time.

Data files not included here due to their size - if you're interested, they can be downloaded
from https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/icebridge-riegl-laser-altimeter-l2-geolocated-surface-elevation-triplets-v001
